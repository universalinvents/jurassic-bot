# Jurassic Bot

This sample project was built using the template generated by the
[Facebook Messenger QuickStart Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/getting-started/quick-start)

The [Complete Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/implementation) goes deeper into the features available.

Visit the [dev site](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/) to find out more details about the Messenger Platform.

## Messenger Platform Sample -- node.js

This project is an example server for creating a Jurassic World bot utilizing the Messenger Platform built in Node.js.

It contains the following functionality:

* Webhook (specifically for Messenger Platform events)
* Send API
* Broadcast API
* Other Messenger Platform features

The full tutorial can be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/quickstart

### Setup

Set the following parameters in `node/config/default.json` before running the sample.

| Placeholder          | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ${APP_SECRET}        | This is the generated app secret for your Facebook application.  All of your Facebook apps can be found here: https://developers.facebook.com/apps |
| ${PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN} | This is the access token that enables this app to respond for your chosen Facebook page.                                                           |
| ${GOOGLE_MAP_KEY}    | Part of this sample application uses the Google Maps API.  Generate a sample access token with the Maps API and insert it here.                    |

Replace values for `APP_ID` and `PAGE_ID` in `node/public/index.html`.  This is a simple landing page for the webhook service.

Some of the values (e.g. `promo.gifId`) in the `node/config/default.json` file will contain references to media asset `attachments` uploaded using the [Facebook Attachment Upload API](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/reference/attachment-upload-api/).  As you'll see in this documentation, each request requires a `PAGE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, which is unique per Facebook page.  Therefore, you will need to upload your own assets and replace the values in the config file in order to properly display the associated content.

### Whitelisting Domains

All referenced external resources (e.g. www.google.com) must be whitelisted in the Facebook page settings under the **Message Platform** tab.  The following domains are referenced by this sample bot and should therefore be added to the whitelist.

| Domain Name                                                                   |

### Run

You can start the server by running `npm start` int the node directory. However, the webhook must be at a public URL that the Facebook servers can reach. Therefore, running the server locally on your machine will not work.

You can run this example on a cloud service provider like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform or AWS. Note that webhooks *must* have a valid SSL certificate, signed by a certificate authority. Read more about setting up SSL for a [Webhook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/webhooks#setup).

### Webhook

All webhook code is in `node/app.js`. It is routed to the `/webhook` endpoint. More details are available at the [reference docs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/webhook-reference).

This sample bot app requires the following webhook events to be enabled for this Facebook app.  The settings can be found under **Product > Messenger > Settings** in FB app developer portal.
<INSERT TABLE>

| Domain Name          |
|----------------------|
| messages             |
| messaging_postbacks  |
| messaging_referrals  |

### Example Requests

Sample `curl` requests to the Facebook Messenger APIs can be found in **requirements.txt**.

Example request use cases are as follows:

* Defining a greeting message
* Creating a persistent menu
* Uploading files using the Attachment Upload API
* Sending ad-hoc messages to users
